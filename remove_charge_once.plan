(bat-lvl turtle) has a finite upper bound: [-inf,5.000]
Have identified that bigger values of (bat-lvl turtle) are preferable
[01;34mNo analytic limits found, not considering limit effects of goal-only operators[00m
Assignment numeric effect ((bat-lvl turtle) = 5.000) makes effects on 0 be order-dependent
